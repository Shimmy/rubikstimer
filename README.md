A Rubiks Cube Timer for Arduino

You need the LCD display, connect it as done in the LiquidCrystal Library Hello world example.
Then add two switches, switchPinA and switchPinB, connect to port 8 and 9.

When both switches are pressed simultaneously the timer is started, and next time they are pressed the timer stops.

That's about it.
